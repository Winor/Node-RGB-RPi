## Prerequisites
In order to use RPiLC you need:
* A Raspberry Pi.
* Node.js version 8.0.0 or newer installed (you can follow [this](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md) to install the latest Node.js version on your Pi).
* Pigpio C library (Version V41 or higher)
* Python-setuptools & Python3-setuptools (required for Pigpio)
* RGB led strip connected to the Pi's GPIO (you can follow [this guide](http://dordnung.de/raspberrypi-ledstrip/) for wiring)

##  Install RPiLC on your Pi

#### 1. Get the files

Get the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Winor/RPiLC/releases/latest) and extract it to a new folder, or do:
```
git clone https://github.com/Winor/RPiLC
```
#### 2. Install dependencies

```
cd RPiLC
npm install
```
#### 3. Run
Note that in order to run RPiLC, the app has to be ran with root privilags so it can have accsess to the Pi's GPIO.
```
sudo node index.js
``` 

#### 4. Configure
Visit http://127.0.0.1 in your browser and configure the app to match your setup.
You can also edit config.json manually after it is generated by the app.

## Run RPiLC on startup using pm2
You can start RPiLC on startup by following these steps:
### 1. Install pm2
Note that in order to run RPiLC on startup, pm2 has to run the app as root so RPiLC can get accsess to the Pi's GPIO. 
```
sudo npm install pm2@latest -g
```
### 2. Add RPiLC to pm2
```
cd [RPiLC location]
sudo pm2 start index.js --name RPiLC
```
### 3. Make pm2 run on startup
```
sudo pm2 startup
```

## API
Use HTTP get requests to interact with your LED strip, for example ``http://127.0.0.1/api/set/blue`` will set the LED strip color to blue.
Every request will return data in JSON format.
